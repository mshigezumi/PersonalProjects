# PersonalProjects

This is my own personal project making an Advance Wars style game, by no means is anything final yet and I'm currently exploring the best ways to implement specific features I would like to add while using the TBS Framework. Not shown here is large amounts of notes and data on possible avenues to explore and analysis of damage systems in similar games. Currently exploring the pros and cons of different systems implementing accuracy, damage, penetration, armor, range, ammo, costs, etc.

Also currently using Odin Inspector and Doozy UI Manager.
