# PersonalProjects

This is my own personal project making an Advance Wars style game, by no means is anything final yet and I'm currently exploring the best ways to implement specific features I would like to add while using the TBS Framework. Not shown here is large amounts of notes and data on possible avenues to explore and analysis of damage systems in similar games. Currently exploring the pros and cons of different systems implementing accuracy, damage, penetration, armor, range, ammo, costs, etc.

The code is very much still being worked on so there are comments with my notes and different implementations commented out in case I need it in the future. Certain fuctions also don't work quite yet as I figure out the best way to implement them with future growth/changes in mind.

Also currently using Odin Inspector and Doozy UI Manager.
